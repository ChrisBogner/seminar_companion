["presentation.html", "Chapter 3 Presentation 3.1 Presenting student 3.2 Peers 3.3 Feedback rules", " Chapter 3 Presentation 3.1 Presenting student We will establish more detailed criteria of a good scientific presentation during the seminar. Thus, the following requirements are general and a strict minimum: Content Title slide (title, your name, title of the seminar) Motivation slide: Why is this topic relevant and why does it need a critical review Body of your presentation: Here, you give information on your topic Critical evaluation or discussion Take-home messages: Summarize the most important aspects References: you prepare, but do not show this slide Cite the literature and all figures/tables/data you use correctly! Time You have 15 minutes to present your topic. Afterwords, we will have a group discussion. Feedback You will receive feedback from your peers in form of one-minute papers through campuswire. Therefore, in class feed, post the title of your presentation. Your peers will respond to this post with their feedback. 3.2 Peers Listen carefully and critically to the presenter and provide anonymous feedback through campuswire. Structure your feedback as follows: The main points of the presentation: Summarize what you understood in 2–3 sentences. The presenter should see whether his/her take-home messages were received. State which concrete issues you observed (see feedback rules below) Suggest concrete ways to improve and further aspects to include in the review paper. 3.3 Feedback rules 3.3.1 How to give feedback A peer feedback should always be provided as a personal opinion and communicated accordingly. A peer feedback, both written and oral is respectful me-centered addresses a concrete observation tells what it did to the feedback provider provides a doable suggestion On slide 4, you explained that carbon sequestration in the soil depended on temperature. I am not familiar with this and did not understand the relationship to climate change. Could you please explain this in your paper in more detail. For your paper, you could also include the aspect of increasing CO2 in the atmosphere and ocean acidification. 3.3.2 How to receive feedback Remember that the feedback is a personal opinion. Therefore, don’t take it personally don’t apologize take it and say thank you you decide whether you want to implement this feedback "],
["literature-review.html", "Chapter 4 Literature review 4.1 Literature search 4.2 General structure and length of your review 4.3 Software 4.4 Plagiarism", " Chapter 4 Literature review 4.1 Literature search Use the literature data base Web of Science or Google Scholar to find your literature. You will have a blended learning unit on how to use the data bases. For Web of Science, either create an account and link it to UoC or activate your VPN client when accessing from outside the university. 4.2 General structure and length of your review Your review must be structured as follows: Title page: contains your name, the title of the seminar, the name of your lecturer and the submission date Abstract Key words Table of content Introduction Method Main part Discussion Conclusions References Your review should be between 3000 and 6000 words in the main part (i.e. without abstract, table of contents, references etc.). 4.3 Software You can select any free or commercial word processing software, e.g. Libre Office, Open Office, LaTeX or Word. However, be sure to correctly connect your word processor to your bibliography manager. Do not copy and paste references manually because this is very error prone and you risk to forget citations. You are also free to select any reference management software. The free Zotero is recommended, but the UoC also provides licences for Citavi and Endnote to manage your bibliography. In case you decide to use Zotero, there is a helpful video tutorial explaining how to use it and how to connect it to your word processing software. We will use a citation style close to the one used by the journal Geomorphology. You can download the style for Zotero here and for Endnote here. If you want to use Citavi, you have to find an appropriate style yourself. 4.4 Plagiarism You will have a blended learning unit on plagiarism and how to avoid it. We will exercise paraphrasing during the seminar. I will check your paper draft for plagiarism with turnitin and give you detailed feedback. The final paper will also be checked for plagiarism. Plagiarism will result in a worse grade and substantial plagiarism in failing the seminar. "],

["scientific-english.html", "Chapter 6 Scientific English 6.1 How to write clear scientific English? 6.2 Paraphrasing of longer texts 6.3 Further reading and excercises", " Chapter 6 Scientific English 6.1 How to write clear scientific English? The material in this section is based on Skern (2009). He suggests 8 guidelines that will help you to write in a clear and concise way: Plan your writing Use a clean and legible layout Structure your text in paragraphs Write simple sentences Write positive statements Write active statements Omit unnecessary words Read, think, write, read again and think again 6.2 Paraphrasing of longer texts Every sentence you paraphrase or idea you take from others’ work must be references. The reader should be able to distinguish between your ideas and thoughts and others’ contributions. To avoid placing references after every sentence, you might use the following style: X and Y explain in their paper that agricultural fields were contaminated by microplastics (reference). This is a global rather than local issue so the authors. Therefore, they suggest to implement a global monitoring programm to tackle micropalstics contamination. In the same paper, X and Y mention that to reduce littering of microplastics the production of one-way plastics must be reduced. It is clear that all the content comes from X and Y although the reference itself appears only once in the text. Other helpful expressions for paraphrasing: according to the work of \\(\\dots\\) our results accord well with \\(\\dots\\) X and Y suggest \\(\\dots\\) this result is also supported by X and Y (reference) 6.3 Further reading and excercises Read chapter 2 in Skern (2009) and do the exercises. Compare your solutions to his suggestions. "],
