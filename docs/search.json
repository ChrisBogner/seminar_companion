What is the research question or the goal of your review?\nMethod: summarize your literature search here. When did you the search? In which databases? Which keywords did you use? How did you exclude irrelevant papers?\nMain part: you can name it differently, depending on your topic. In this part, you present your results. In most cases, you will subdivide this section in several subsections\nDiscussion: Discuss critically your topic and the results you have summarized in the Main part. The focus is not on rating the papers, but on critical assessment of their content. Answer your research questions!\nConclusions: Summary and take-home messages.\nReferences\n\nIf you use many abbreviations, put a list of abbreviations after the keywords.\nYour review should be between 4000 and 6000 words (excluding abstract, keywords, table of contents, list of abbreviations and references).",

    "text": "3.2 Plagiarism\n\n3.2.1 What is plagiarism and how to avoid it\nThere are many ways to define plagiarism. However, they all include basically the same aspects. Read the definition of plagiarism from the Appendix H in @Darr2019: “Combating Plagiarism: a Hands-On Guide for Librarians, Teachers, and Students” (uploaded on ILIAS). You can access the whole book here. You have to create an account first and then to sign in. Don’t forget to activate your VPN client when accessing from outside the UoC.\n\n\n3.2.2 Paraphrasing\nA crucial step in avoiding plagiarism is to learn to paraphrase the original source correctly and give a correct citation. While citing correctly is largely facilitated by the reference management software, paraphrasing has to be practised.\n\n\n3.2.3 Common knowledge\nNot every idea you use in your paper needs to be cited. Common knowledge does not need any reference. However, you cannot copy it verbatim. Thus, it is important to learn to distinguish between citable information (that will be either paraphrased or quoted) and common knowledge. What constitutes common knowledge, can depend on the context and the audience you address. In our case, you can consider your audience to be (reasonably well) educated science graduates.\n\n\n3.2.4 Assignments\n\nRead pp. 17–22 in Chapter 2 “Paraphrasing and Micro-Paraphrasing” by @Darr2019 (uploaded on ILIAS) using the SQ4R method and take notes. Bring your notes to the next class.\nLook at the following examples and decide whether the information (i) constitutes common knowledge and only needs to be paraphrased, (ii) should be paraphrased and cited or (iii) quoted directly and cited. For every example, write a justification and submit it to ILIAS.\n\n\nBogner (2014): Landslides are a ubiquitous phenomenon in mountainous regions.\nBogner (2014): Image indices are real-valued functions in the range [0, 1] that calculate certain properties of binary images and thus provide quantitative information about the morphology of flow patterns.\nNülle (2014): Following the invention of the first modern plastic “Bakelit” in 1907, inexpensive high-volume manufacturing techniques were developed.\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/: The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 and aim at improving living condition by 2030 while protecting the environment.\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg5: Sustainable Development Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.",
