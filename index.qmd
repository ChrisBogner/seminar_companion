<!-- The corona virus pandemic still impacts our lives and changes the way we teach and learn. This course will be held in person, I hope we are back to nearly normal. We learnt a lot during the online-teaching phase and some of the tools proved useful. Thus, I will try to move some of them into the in-person phase. -->
<!-- ``` -->

In this seminar we will use the following tools for communication:

**ILIAS**: the e-learning platform of the university. You should have been registered automatically for the course.

<!-- **Campuswire**: the online chat and communication platform. You should have received an invitation to join. -->
