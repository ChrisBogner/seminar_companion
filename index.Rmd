# Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

```{block, type='rmdinfo'}
The corona virus pandemic still impacts our lives and changes the way we teach and learn. This course will be held in person, I hope we are back to nearly normal. We learnt a lot during the online-teaching phase and some of the tools proved useful. Thus, I will try to move some of them into the in-person phase.
```

In this seminar we will use different tools for communication:

**ILIAS**: the e-learning platform of the university. You should have been registered automatically for the course.

**Campuswire**: the online chat and communication platform. You should have received an invitation to join.


In this companion, I will use blocks to highlight particular content

```{block, type='rmdinfo'}
This is an info block.

```{block, type='rmdexample'}
